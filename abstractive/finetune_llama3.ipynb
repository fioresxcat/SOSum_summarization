The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs \"triggered\" or \"marked\". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this \"cascade of execution\" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the \"outside world\" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change.\n",
      "Ground Truth:  OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external \"stimuli\" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs \"triggered\" or \"marked\". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Reactive programming imports this \"cascade of execution\" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the \"outside world\" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs \"reacts\" to them. Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.\n",
